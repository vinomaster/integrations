# Integration Projects

This DIF repo serves as a collection of industry vertical integration projects. Each project is intended as a series of industry specific use cases that can be implemented and tested for identity and verifiable claims (credentials) interoperability.

Ideally, each project should minimally contain the following artifacts that frame the industry challenge:

* Industry pain points
* Desired goals 
* Ecosystem Diagram
* User Stories with associated use cases
* Use case interaction diagrams

Community participants can tackle portions of one or more projects and collaborate with others to provide live exemplars of how industry integration scenarios can be implemented using concepts from DIF.
